# Sudoku-game

Sudoku is a logic-based number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids that compose the grid contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.

To play the game, you need to use your mouse and your keyboard. With your mouse, you can select a Sudoku cube and with your keyboard, you can press one of the numbers from 1 to 9 and press enter to insert the number into the cube. To delete a number, press the delete button.
A green color indicates a valid number and a red color indicates that the number is not valid.
